* Implement C backend
  * Simple optimization: empty list of type variables are completely ignored
* Implement monomorphization
* Implement pretty printer FGG->Go (crashes if type variables are found)

We then have:

FGG--------> C (polymorphic)
 |
 |
 +---------> C (monomorphic)
 |
 |
 +---------> Go (monomorphic)

* Benchmarks:
  * Lookup in binary search tree
  * Simple hash table
